    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      The best would be to integrate web security tools early during the
      software development. This can help eliminate issues early in the
      development phase and save time in the future. Involving the entire
      development team in security practices will help. By involving the entire
      team each person will have a sense of responsibility and a role to help
      keep things secure. The company will also benefit by educating the team on
      security practices and this can save time and money in the future as well.
      Some recommendations would be to use effective password management and
      encourage stronger password use. This can be done by using two-factor
      authentication for the site. The server the company is using should also
      be configured to use HTTPS/HTTP Strict Transport Security to encrypt data
      sent from the client to the server and ensure login credentials. Dynamic
      Application Security Testing (DAST) should be performed. Using
      vulnerability scanning tools to perform automated security testing on the
      site to look for vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting, SQL
      Injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal, and insecure server
      configurations. In addition, it would be best to implement penetration
      testing with vulnerability scanning. Penetration exercises done by a team
      can also continuously help maintain security awareness and improve
      efficiency and preparedness in case of an actual attack. (sited from
